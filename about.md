## Built upon awesome microframeworks

We're not building everything from scratch just pulling together the best of whats available...

## A decoupled semantic framework

When using frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation, [markup tends to be highly verbose and is coupled tightly to the framework itself.](https://coderwall.com/p/wixovg).

This has led to many developers to turn to SASS as a means to decouple the markup, and to use semantic naming conventions such as BEM, 
[allowing for more maintainable and readable css](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/maintainable-css-with-bem/).

However, it is known that using SASS to extend Bootstrap framework classes, for example, can lead to unnecesarily large files css files, as explained in [this article](http://thesassway.com/editorial/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do).

This framework will be a fresh approach to sass frameworks by providing silent sass classes and mixins, together with a focus on BEM naming conventions to bring the best of both css frameworks and future maintainability.
